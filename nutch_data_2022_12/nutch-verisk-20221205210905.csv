Job Description Applied Statistician: Atmospheric Perils Modeling Come join the Stochastic Atmospheric Perils Modeling Team in Verisk Extreme Event Solution’s Boston-based Research Department, and contribute to building the next generation of probabilistic catastrophe models for assessing the risk of extreme weather. Our team’s projects offer opportunities for creative problem-solving on a boundless set of interesting statistical problems at the interface of extreme weather, climate change, and risk. Catastrophe models depend fundamentally on hierarchical modeling of space-time physical processes, inference from heterogeneous and incomplete calibration data, and use of ensemble techniques to quantify uncertainties. We learn continuously through interdisciplinary collaborations with a diverse team of meteorologists, applied mathematicians, climate scientists, engineers, and hydrologists. As such, this is a fantastic position for a curious statistician with an interest in modeling atmospheric processes! In addition to possessing sharp technical skills, we also hope you will bring a practical, applied mindset to the role. Our team’s work contributes toward building tools that enable the (re)insurance sector to make sound decisions to enhance social resilience to natural catastrophes. Day To Day Responsibilities First projects are likely to be contributing collaboratively to model formulation, improvement, and implementation for building Verisk’s next generation tropical cyclone models. Work with domain-area experts in meteorology, hydrology, and engineering to understand relevant data sets and translate model calibration and validation needs into statistical analysis and models. Analyze and validate Verisk Extreme Event Solution’s simulated hurricane track sets against observational data to ensure statistical robustness. Perform validation exercises to demonstrate statistical rigor of models, sometimes as part of regulatory requirements. As part of a team, defend the statistical analysis on behalf of Verisk Extreme Event Solutions to external clients and reviewers. Contribute to identification, inference, and modeling of significant non-stationarities in tropical cyclone data, including those that may be due to climate change. Help formulate answers to client questions related to the statistical aspects of Verisk Extreme Event Solution’s tropical cyclone models. Soundboard modeling problems of fellow statistician team members working on other projects, and contribute to a team culture of mutual support, respect, and continued learning. Qualifications Advanced degree in statistics or equivalent statistical modeling experience required (PhD in statistics preferred; position can be flexed for early or mid-career applicants for candidates with a great fit in skills and interests.) Theoretical and applied command of time-series and/or spatial and/or spatio-temporal statistical modeling techniques. Comfort with Bayesian hierarchical modeling required. Excellent communication in both technical and non-technical contexts Ability to present and defend statistical results on behalf of the organization in front of external statisticians and regulators. Willingness and confidence to provide statistical leadership and guidance to team members and senior management. Motivated to contribute creative technical solutions to collaborative team projects, and to implement solutions reproducibly in robust and well-tested code Fluency in R programming language is a necessity Programming in other languages (python, Matlab, Fortran, C, C++, Java) would be a plus, as would be proficiency in shell scripting and cluster computing Expertise in any of the following topics would be a bonus: data assimilation, extreme value theory, Gaussian process emulation of high-dimensional computer models Experience modeling atmospheric or climatic phenomena, or interpreting statistical inference in terms of physical systems, would be a significant advantage. Experience with R package development and version control would also strengthen candidacy. Strong organizational skills that promote reproducible research workflows are also desired.
