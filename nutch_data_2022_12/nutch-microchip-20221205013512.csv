Job Description Microchip’s FPGA software engineering team develops the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software used by our customers to program Microchip FPGAs. Customers perform their entire FPGA design flow using our software: from design entry, to synthesis, through place-and-route, timing, power analysis, and simulation. The High-Level Synthesis (HLS) software engineering group develops Microchip’s high-level synthesis integrated development environment. High-level synthesis allows our customers to program FPGAs using the C/C++ software language. Customers who program FPGAs using the C/C++ language are significantly more productive because C/C++ has a higher level of abstraction than traditional low-level FPGA languages like Verilog/VHDL. Customers achieve shorter design times, easier verification, and faster time-to-market using high-level synthesis. As a software engineer in the High-Level Synthesis group, you will work on the next generation system-level software with a team of industry-leading experts. You will be joining an agile fast-paced engineering team, where you will solve highly challenging yet interesting problems. You will have ownership over meaningful new software projects from inception to development, testing, writing user documentation, and releasing to Microchip FPGA customers. Responsibilities Contribute to our next generation system-level compiler to generate high-performance system-on-chip (SoC) designs from a C/C++ algorithmic description for our state-of-the-art next generation FPGA architecture. Our compiler is built on the open-source LLVM compiler infrastructure. You will develop and improve LLVM compiler transformation/analysis passes and implement new dialects for targeting SoC FPGAs. Perform system-level analysis and profiling to allow SW/HW partitioning, infer vector operations, and utilize interconnection networks. Optimize SoC architecture to improve the quality of generated designs (Fmax and area). Investigate complex real-life customer applications designed with high-level synthesis to optimize performance/area and implement new compiler features as required.

Our embedded solutions serve a wide array of target markets and applications. Our devices are focused on applications that require robust, low-latency sensing and control with digital signal processing at a low cost. Who We’re Looking For… The world of embedded control encompasses many specialties, but we aren’t looking for a specialist at all. This is a ‘big-picture’ role that ensures everything about a microcontroller SoC device plays well together. Can you visualize how the device might fit into a larger system? What are the lower level hardware requirements that will make it a good fit for the targeted application? What new IP must be designed or purchased? How is that IP going to be tested and what standards must be met? What will the IP interfaces look like? Can cost and schedule targets be met? These are the types of questions that this role will encounter on a daily basis. Do you possess most of the following traits? Ability to operate independently day to day Ability to own and drive decisions across a team when there may be uncertainty Willingness to step outside traditional job role when needed Willingness to seek others opinions Willingness to admit you don’t know and acquire new knowledge Understanding of cost/schedule driven product development Excellent written and verbal communication skills Able to explain complex technical subject matter to multiple levels of technical ability Ideally, you have 15+ or more years of career experience and you have spent that time performing a variety of engineering roles. You will have a degree in Electrical Engineering and/or Computer Science. A wide range of system design and product development experience that includes analog design, digital design and software is extremely helpful. And, given the nature of our product line, knowledge of proprietary or standard microcontroller architectures is extremely helpful. How You Will Contribute… You will work as an individual, but you must interact with and influence various functional teams within the business unit. The task on any given day will vary, but the key responsibility is to create detailed, low-level architectural specifications for the device and its components based on a firm understanding of the high level product requirements. The individual problems that you work on may involve these aspects of the device: Device manufacturing process selection Device packaging and pinouts Power management including voltage regulation and low power states Analog peripherals and associated digital controllers such as ADC, DAC, Op-Amps Internal bus architecture and bus protocols Communication protocols such as UART, SPI, I2C, CAN, Ethernet, USB Peripherals for specific target applications Device architecture and features for application security Device architecture and feature set for functional safety Device feature set for production testing How We Will Contribute To Your Success… This is a dynamic and challenging technical leadership role with high visibility – you will have the opportunity to work across expertise domains and to develop deeper expertise in one or more of those domains. Through mentoring, internal/external training, and on-the-job experience, you will gain solid knowledge in many of the technical areas listed above. You will ultimately make the decisions for ‘gray’ technical problems with no clear options. And, you will also have to ability to increase your recognition through efforts such as Patent filing, technical training and communications with your peers and members of the Executive Staff.
