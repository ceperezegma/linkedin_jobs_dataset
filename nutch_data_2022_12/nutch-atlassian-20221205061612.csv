Interviews and onboarding are conducted virtually, a part of being a distributed-first company. Atlassian is growing faster than ever and has an opportunity for a Design Technologist to join our design operations team, Design Hub. The Design Hub team is a cross-disciplinary design operations team focused on enabling more effective designers and a more efficient Experience Design org. We own the operationalizing, optimizing, and scaling of design by designing practices, systems, and tools that drive operational and craft excellence. Reporting to the Head of Design Ops, this person will contribute to critical CX initiatives for the Design Hub team, focused on developing tooling that help bring efficiencies to design activities as well as enable the effectiveness and value of Atlassian designers and design teams at scale. Does this sound fun to you? You might just be the person we're looking for. In This Role, You Will Own, augment, and build the tools our designers use—we're not afraid to build new tools, dogfood our own products, or explore the newest technologies to make our work better and more collaborative. Work to make designers’ lives simpler, more efficient, and more productive by building custom tooling and apps, developing instrumented quality scorecards, and identifying opportunities for innovation and efficiency improvements. Work with Design Hub teammates to better understand what gaps exist in internal process, knowledge, or tooling across our design teams Build tools that make prototyping within the Experience Design organization easier and more tightly To be successful in this role, you… …have a high bar and an eye for good design—you care about the details, love working with designs and designers, and are unafraid to contribute constructive, thoughtful feedback on work. …are organized, proactive, and thrive in the details–even as you work in a fast-paced, sometimes ambiguous environment. You think strategically, recognize the importance of long-term goals, have vision, and are committed to success. …are an excellent communicator who knows how to connect with people all over the globe at various levels of seniority, and you're comfortable calling ""BS"" if you see it - even with execs. …seek out opportunities to improve and optimize - constantly searching for new knowledge (and new ideas!) and you’re willing to learn and try better ways of working. …are a systems thinker who always has a line of sight to the big picture.
