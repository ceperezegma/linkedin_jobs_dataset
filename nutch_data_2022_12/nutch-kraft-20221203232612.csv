Kraft Heinz recently published the 2020 ESG Report- which highlights critical packaging sustainability commitments- as part of the greater enterprise strategy. Included in the commitments is for all packaging to be recyclable- reusable- or compostable by 2025. Therefore- the co-op was tasked with exploring new packaging that could be recyclable to replace current- non-recyclable packaging. This project established the proof of concept for package material variables to meet recyclability criteria and KHC manufacturing and product performance requirements for products. Packaging improvements to a high volume product could result in a material reduction of 2 to 4 million pounds annually- which helps support our 2025 sustainability goals. The project challenge was to prove out parity performance of the new packaging in terms of quality tests- product interaction- shelf life- and match performance at the factory site while creating an exceptional package for the consumer and our environment.

Kraft purchased the Phenix Cheese Company in 1928- only 25 years after selling cheese to grocers in Chicago from his horse drawn wagon. In 1929- approximately 90 employees in the Kraft-Phenix Cheese Plant in Beaver Dam produced 10 million pounds of Philadelphia Cream Cheese- Neufchatel- Camambert Cheeses- along with butter and sweet cream. Separation technology- which allowed cream cheese to stay fresher much longer – going from 18 days to 120 days- was developed in Beaver Dam by Oscar J. Link in the 1940’s. In the 1960’s the plant underwent a major remodeling to add additional cooler storage and dry storage. Kraft Heinz continues to invest in the Beaver Dam facility with state-of-the-art technologies in the cream cheese industry.

Kraft purchased the Phenix Cheese Company in 1928- only 25 years after selling cheese to grocers in Chicago from his horse drawn wagon. In 1929- approximately 90 employees in the Kraft-Phenix Cheese Plant in Beaver Dam produced 10 million pounds of Philadelphia Cream Cheese- Neufchatel- Camambert Cheeses- along with butter and sweet cream. Separation technology- which allowed cream cheese to stay fresher much longer – going from 18 days to 120 days- was developed in Beaver Dam by Oscar J. Link in the 1940’s. In the 1960’s the plant underwent a major remodeling to add additional cooler storage and dry storage. Kraft Heinz continues to invest in the Beaver Dam facility with state-of-the-art technologies in the cream cheese industry.
