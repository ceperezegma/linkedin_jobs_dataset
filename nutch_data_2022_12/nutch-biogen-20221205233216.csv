Job Description This application is for a 6-month student role from January - June 2023. Resume review begins in October 2022. Medical Affairs (MA) is an integral department within any pharmaceutical or biotechnology company and serves as a key connection to the wider medical community. There are four basic functions of any MA department: insights generation, evidence generation, crafting the “global scientific platform” (GSP), and medical education. The first two involve understanding and addressing medical needs, while the third and fourth facilitate consistent, accurate, and relevant stakeholder education. The global scientific platform is the central scientific story for a disease state or product, and the role of MA is to help communicate this information to the broader medical community. At Biogen, the Med Affairs department is titled Worldwide Medical (WWM). MSLs, a pivotal role within MA, are the main point of contact for peer-to-peer medical education, as they have the responsibility of providing HCPs with timely and accurate information on the company’s medicines and research areas. MSLs work in synergy with two other important departments within MA: (1) Medical Information, which responds to drug-information inquiries, and (2) Scientific Partnerships, which disseminates data at medical congresses and in peer-reviewed publications. WWM also supports independent medical education, in the form of Continuing Medical Education (CME). At Biogen, the group responsible for responding to requests for funding for CME (grants) is the Grants Management and Strategic Giving (GMSG) department. The role of the GMSG is to disseminate unbiased, scientific data to the healthcare community, in ways that respond to the learning needs of healthcare providers. Although these four basic functions are integral to the way WWM operates, the role of WWM is continuing to grow and adapt, with greater emphasis on the patient (eg, outcomes that are clinically meaningful to patients and personalized medicine) and we are focused on innovative, digital approaches to reaching target audiences with personally relevant information. By building upon these four basic functions, WWM is poised to further strengthen the patient’s voice, thereby becoming true partners to patients, their families, healthcare providers, and the global community of which we are all a part. In this way, we contribute to Biogen’s mission to pioneer in neuroscience. Since our founding in 1978 as one of the world’s first global biotechnology companies, Biogen has led innovative scientific research with the goal over the last decade to defeat devastating neurological diseases. Position Description Detailed description of role including but not limited to: This project is to collaborate with the Grants and Strategic Giving team to create a business impact report template to inform leaders in Worldwide Medical on a set of metrics, key performance indicators or insights on the Grants and Strategic Giving program. The report should encompass program impacts, key learnings, educational gaps, site launch information and other metrics. The report should be succinct, easy to read and interpret. Day to day responsibilities will include getting familiar with the backend of the new grants and strategic giving website, downloading relevant data, cleansing and prepping the data, preparing the data for presentation in a dashboard that can be added to a powerpoint deck for discussions with leadership. Responsibilities will also include getting to know the GMSG team, their business objectives and understanding which key performance metrics will provide the most value to leaders and decision-makers. Responsibilities will also include frequent MS Teams meetings and regular check-ins with the GSMG team. Knowledge Qualifications Enrolled in Bachelor’s level program with a major in any of the following disciplines: Health and medical administrative services, Registered nursing/registered nurse, Neuroscience, Research and experimental psychology, Biology/biological sciences, Pharmacy, Information science/studies, Biological and biomedical sciences, Pharmaceutical sciences, Business/commerce or Computer and information sciences Skills Ability to apply strategic and analytical thinking to a reporting project.
