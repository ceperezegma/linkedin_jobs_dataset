We design software to explore what new hardware might bring to our current and future products. It is our job to invent and propose new features and sometimes entirely new products. Over the past decade we have incubated products like iPad, Pencil, and Apple TV Siri Remote. We pioneered force and haptics for Multi-Touch trackpads, iPhone, and Apple Watch. We were instrumental in the interface design and development of multi-camera systems, LiDAR, TrueDepth, Face ID, Animoji, and depth photography. We express our ideas through pictures, animation, video and code. The work we do is on a 3–5-year timescale — if it makes it into a product... We are looking for people with a variety of capabilities and interests. We are not filling a specific role, we are looking for people to add something special to our team. We are open to people with any background and any amount of experience. It does not matter to us what tool you use or what medium you work in. We are interested in your ideas and how you express them. Key Qualifications • We don’t expect you to be able to do all of these things. If you have any of these capabilities, we would like to hear from you • Visual Design 2D or 3D. Create static visual communication artifacts. Important aspects are form, color, alignment, type, and layout. Illustrated or rendered. You will make things with aesthetic breadth beyond the Apple style. • Animation 2D or 3D. Use motion in a complementary and tasteful way to direct attention and describe interactions. You will create motion that strike a balance between artful — how it feels, and practical — what it communicates. • Interactive Prototyping 2D or 3D. Make something people can try with taps, swipes, or clicks. Not necessarily an app — whatever communicates an idea. • Interaction Design. Design new affordances and capabilities that are discoverable, easy to perform, and provide clear feedback. You will pay attention to how everything you make responds before, during, and after interaction. Description For everyone on the team, these core values are important to us: • Communication. You can explain your work to people from different disciplines. You provide constructive feedback. You encourage dialogue and inclusion. • Open. You accept feedback on your work and act on it. You are willing to try anything – even things you don’t believe in. “Yes, and...” • Reliable. You do what you say you will do, when you said you would do it. When things change, you tell people. • Invention. Unexpected ideas and solutions. Inspiration and techniques from other fields or disciplines. • Initiative. Ideas and concepts no one asked for. You just jump in and make things. You do not wait for instructions or need permission. • Divergence. You try multiple approaches and learn from them before deciding what to do next. Willing to share concepts that might challenge or displease. Willing to keep unpopular options alive to see where they go. Role Number: 200345998","Cupertino, CA",

At Apple, new ideas have a way of becoming extraordinary products, services, and customer experiences very quickly. Bring passion and dedication to your job and there's no telling what you could accomplish. The people here at Apple don’t just craft products -- they build the kind of wonder that’s revolutionized entire industries. Apple University provides wide-ranging and outstanding educational programs for Apple employees. Through our original curricula, we strive to cultivate deeper understanding, critical reflection, and engaged discussion about Apple’s culture, organization, and values, and about the social context and public culture in which Apple works. To advance these daring aims, Apple University crafts and delivers original classes, tools, workshops, and media. These offerings help encourage intellectual curiosity, sustain debate, and build thoughtful and informed leadership throughout the company. The University team includes faculty from academia, with deep expertise in select subject areas, as well as faculty who previously held leadership roles within Apple and were drawn to instruct. They work with the Production team, which includes the broad areas of expertise required to develop, produce, and deliver all of the offerings listed above. Designers within Apple University work side-by-side faculty, content producers, and the program team, to bring all of our materials to life. They use the power of design to clarify, connect, and surprise. Senior designers operate at multiple levels — crafting the structure and form of materials and getting into the details of the deliverable. They do this across a breadth of media, including websites, presentations, documents, videos, and apps. As part of the university, designers and creators who excel will find engagement in the ideas and thinking that underlie our work — they will obsess over how to convey it simply, beautifully, and in a way that engages others in reflection and discussion. Key Qualifications 8–10 years crafting and designing in a range of styles and media — static, dynamic, and interactive. You have taken briefs and come up with original and conceptual designs and styles. As a bonus, you have designed to help educate. Expertise in Adobe suite, Keynote, Sketch, Blender, FCP, Motion, and 3D design tools. Some understanding of HTML, CSS, and/or other interactive technologies. While this role is focused on graphics and animation, you may be asked to work on some UI and UX — so you’re extra qualified if you have experience with or curiosity about those areas. Experience designing inclusively — attending to accessibility, as well as the wide range of considerations that accompany work that's accessible for everyone. Description Beyond those qualifications, we are looking for a thoughtful, curious, and collaborative designer who can see themselves in the following: - You accept a blank canvas with little to no direction — just an idea. You brainstorm, prototype, and repeat over and over again. (But you also know how to do this against a deadline.) - You also adopt the simplification and refinement of someone else’s prototype. You can pick up others’ work and make it better. - You can enjoy huge projects and confined projects similarly. You like big scope, but won’t balk at crafting a great worksheet. - You will design or draw an image that will capture a phrase or a full essay — to seek to bring together the spirit of ideas. - You’re extremely generative on your own — and also highly collaborative. You’re passionate about your ideas, but also humble enough to let your ideas go or evolve. - You do not shy away from big or abstract concepts. You can get engaged in understanding and thinking about those ideas — being the “first student” who helps others understand and reflect. - You obsess over the details — like really obsess. You push pixels and debate for hours about them. - You listen to different perspectives/opinions and have to form a point of view about the right ones to absorb. - You can design for feeling as well as information, whether it be Keynote, a website, or a video.

You’re experiencing our work whenever you see a suggested location in Maps or Calendar, or browse your Memories in Photos. We’re working for you whenever your phone engages Do Not Disturb While Driving or remembers where you parked. We’re looking for motivated, experienced technical leaders to help take our software to the next level of capability, quality, and impact. Do you have a background in GPS, WiFi location, or embedded sensing, and are looking to move up the stack? Do you know recommendation engines, and want to apply that experience to a deeply impactful and broadly applicable domain? Are you excited by the optimization problem of providing rich contextual intelligence within a constrained resource footprint? If any of these describe you, read on.

Experience processing real-world data at scale, server-side. Not every candidate will have experience with Spark, Hadoop, or NoSQL data stores, but the best ones will. Description In this job, you’ll develop the next frontier of mobile technology, in partnership with teams in sensing, Siri, and apps. Hungry for the responsibility to work on complex problems from end to end? In this position, you will: - Conceptualize, explore, and define new inferential and predictive location- and motion-based capabilities for Apple's platforms. - Collect, curate, and analyze real-world data sets of varying size and complexity. - Aggregate, filter, and cluster data on mobile devices, from a variety of local sensors: GPS, WiFi, accelerometer, and others. - Design and implement algorithms, then integrate them into production code. - Test your work. Dog-food it. Collect metrics, and iterate. Don’t forget to sweat the edge cases—an issue that impacts 1% of a billion devices is a big issue. A dedication to users’ privacy and security is core to how Apple does business. We want their devices to exhibit the high level of intelligence and proactivity that can only come from deep contextual understanding. We don’t want their sensitive data coming back to Apple or being exposed to third parties. Other companies solve similar problems in very different ways. Our way is more work.
