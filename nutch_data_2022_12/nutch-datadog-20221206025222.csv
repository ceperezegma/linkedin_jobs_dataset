The Continuous Profiler team is building a cutting-edge profiling product that has low enough overhead that it can be run continuously in production. This allows users to have much better profiles since they’re based on real workloads at real scale, and can help solve production incidents. Our goal is to help our users reduce their software’s resource usage (saving money and decreasing environmental footprint), decrease latency, and fix bugs. We’re looking for an engineering manager to help build profiling libraries for some of the languages we support, integrating with, and occasionally contributing to, the various language runtimes. You’ll manage 5 talented engineers and do plenty of your own coding. At Datadog, we place value in our office culture - the relationships and collaboration it builds and the creativity it brings to the table. We operate as a hybrid workplace to ensure our Datadogs can create a work-life harmony that best fits them. What You’ll Do: We build profilers for .NET, C/C++/Rust, Go, Java, Node, PHP, Python, and Ruby. We already have one Team Lead for the client components and you’ll be their peer, leading half of the folks working on these. This is a hybrid role: you’ll spend ~half your time on management, and the rest doing hands-on technical work. You’ll work with and mentor the engineers on your team. This might mean reviewing an RFC or discussing areas where they want to grow or have gaps, and supporting them in developing those skills. You’ll help foster a high-performance and fun culture. You’ll contribute to our profiling libraries – adding cutting-edge functionality and debugging tricky problems. You’ll help us continue to raise the bar on the quality of our code and the stability of our profilers. You’ll help define priorities and build out the roadmap, along with your team, product manager, and other stakeholders. Who You Are: You have excellent communication skills and are emotionally intelligent. You have deep knowledge of at least one of the languages we support. Bonus points if it’s Java, Node, Python, or Ruby. You also know C or C++ and have experience working with subtle concurrency constraints. You’re attentive to details and can build software with very low defect rates. You appreciate simplicity as a tool to accomplish this. You’ve used profilers or done other forms of performance engineering and know how to write efficient software. It’d be nice if you have experience hacking on language runtimes or writing low-level language or systems tools like profilers, compilers, debuggers, or OSes. You’re interested in an environment that values shipping early and iterating, and keeping process to the minimum needed to ensure safety. You enjoy owning projects and can keep moving forward despite the occasional ambiguity or blocker. Datadog values people from all walks of life. We understand not everyone will meet all the above qualifications on day one. That's okay. If you’re passionate about technology and want to grow your skills, we encourage you to apply. Benefits and Growth: Skilled, knowledgeable, and kind teammates to work with and learn from. Interesting challenges of all sorts. You’ll gain experience with low overhead sampling profilers, runtime internals, low level OS details, and how to safely ship software that runs within customer processes at scale. Opportunities to contribute to open source software, like language runtimes. You’ll have a lot of influence on product direction and impact on the business, especially since we continue to grow quickly. Competitive global benefits. Continuous professional development. Benefits and Growth listed above may vary based on the country of your employment and the nature of your employment with Datadog. The reasonably estimated salary for this role at Datadog ranges from $187,000 - $240,000, plus a competitive equity package, and may include variable compensation.

We operate at high scale—trillions of data points per day—allowing for seamless collaboration and problem-solving among Dev, Ops and Security teams globally for tens of thousands of companies. Our engineering culture values pragmatism, honesty, and simplicity to solve hard problems the right way. The Team The Core Resilience team is part of our SRE organization and is responsible for partnering with groups across Datadog to improve our technical and organizational resiliency. We steward the post-mortem and incident response processes across the company, constantly iterating and seeking improvements through the lessons we learn from production. We run training sessions for on-call and incident management and occasionally embed in product groups to ensure we remain aligned and can offer practical solutions to reliability problems. We value: Blamelessness in our processes. Our primary goal in incident reviews is to learn from and adapt our mental models of how our systems run in production. As Nabokov said, complacency is a state of mind that exists only in retrospective. A people-centered approach: ensuring that automation and systems support engineers doing work, not vice versa. An understanding that systems are inherently complex and failure is inevitable. What we can control is how resilient our systems and organization are when responding to these inevitable events. The idea that safety and risk are emergent properties in a socio-technical system and that they arise from a complex interaction of factors that constitute normal work. Resilience is a dynamic process of steering rather than a static quality. What You’ll Do Help run the post-mortem process for the company and partner with teams on writing them, as well as identifying and implementing opportunities to reduce friction and maximize learning value to the organization. Define how we respond to incidents as a company and write software to streamline that process, partnering with our product teams where necessary. Our goal is to support our incident responders as much as possible to deal with complexity. Train our on-callers in our incident and post-mortem processes. This involves both introducing newcomers to on-call responsibilities and refreshing the knowledge of existing engineers. Perform cross-functional engagements with different teams across the organization, embedding in their group for a few weeks in order to either learn about how work is performed or to solve a specific reliability problem. Facilitate incident reviews in a way that emphasizes learning and blamelessness. Write reliability bulletins, blog posts, and other forms of documentation that identify systemic risks to the company, provide actionable remediations, and promote best reliability practices. Who You Are: Somebody who has experience or is interested in the following: Writing software that solves real user problems, as well as reviewing others’ code in an empathetic and collaborative way. We mainly use Go and Python. Analyzing incidents, identifying broader risk patterns, and sharing your findings in an engaging way that other people can understand and learn from. Responding to incidents as an incident commander or responder (preferably those with high-impact), and iteratively improving incident response processes. Teaching and training other engineers on best practices. Familiarity with Kubernetes and distributed systems as well as their potential failure scenarios.
