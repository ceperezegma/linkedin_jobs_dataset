Do you have a deep passion and desire to engineer and operate the world's largest cloud computing infrastructure to build a better world for future generations? This is an exciting opportunity to use the latest cloud computing technologies to help U.S. Government agencies implement innovative cloud computing solutions and solve technical problems. AWS established a specialized group of service teams responsible for the work we are doing with the U.S. Intelligence Community. We are building some of the largest and most complex distributed systems in the world, and we need adaptable people to help us implement and operate them. The AWS Route 53 ADC Ops team is seeking highly motivated engineers who are focused on operational excellence and troubleshooting complex system operations, have a good understanding of Linux, networking, and general knowledge of cloud services. We need engineers who understand how to think big, and simplify solutions to complex problems; all the while ensuring that our customers continue to have the best experience possible. You will be able to take a defined project, break down the work to help define milestones, and feedback mechanisms. You identify when implementations are not highly available or have defects; you investigate systemic patterns. You resolve, mitigate, or escalate operational concerns in a timely manner. Mentorship & Career Growth We are committed to supporting our new team members through a broad mix of Amazon experience, expertise, and tenures. We celebrate knowledge, sharing, and mentorship. Work Life Balance Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance.

The New Regions Strategy and Planning team works closely with a wide set of stakeholders to launch new Amazon Regions across the world. These teams work cross-functionally to run due-diligence specific to a country/project and develop infrastructure solutions suited for that specific geography (real estate or colocation facilities, utilities (water & power), network, permits, design & construction, security, HR, legal, tax, etc.). There are many product and technical considerations about Infrastructure (DC, NW, Servers) that we deploy- which is common to all regions, and many optimization initiatives that we need to drive to meet our standards on safety, security, availability, at most efficient costs. This leader will improve and help innovate New Region infrastructure product by working cross-functionally within AWS. This will include: Developing competitive intelligence about New Region Infrastructure; creating a mechanism for competitive intelligence Driving New Region decisions between EC2, HW Engineering, Design Engineering and Finance teams; taking account of long-term forecasts across Pricing, Server density, power draw and performance trends; and DC/NW Costs. Driving improvement/optimization opportunities modeled in New regions P&L (Utilization, Internal Usage, CPU Mix). - Achieving these will have a material impact on both cost and capacity for new regions. Influencing DC Designs in the context of new regions - New regions business decisions are driven by a high upfront investment in ‘physical space’ (besides power& cooling), We need to ensure that the decisions made for data center design for existing regions will be equally efficient for new regions.

Governance - Maintain a high bar for availability, security, and customer experience. This gives our tools the ability to detect opportunities for improvement, simplify migration and automatic updates, and safely test and validate before being exposed to customers. Builder cross-tool workflows - Identify opportunities to simplify and improve the entire software development process. This helps developers create new applications, make incremental changes to software, and then see those changes successfully released to customers. In total, we have UX opportunities in ASBX for issue tracking, task management, incident alerting and response, change management, application infrastructure tooling, automation tooling for all of those things, metrics gathering for all software builder insights and the resulting data visualization to recommend trustable response, in addition to roles for how we onboard and train software builders whether new or tenured at Amazon, make it easier to publish, share, and discover all content streams to more easily institutionalize tribal knowledge, and create experiences which allow for users to easily move from any of those tools to the others with minimal effort. #ASBX-BT Key job responsibilities Be the UX Research lead for projects that touch numerous aspects of the Amazon software builder experience.
