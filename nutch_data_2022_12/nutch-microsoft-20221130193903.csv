Our researchers and engineers pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment. In recent years, the AI landscape has been transformed by the emergence of large-scale pre-trained models. The advances of such models truly transform what’s possible in terms of performance, capabilities, and applications. However, it also introduces challenges in energy consumption, adapting the models to new tasks and changing environments, and ensuring that the AI we develop helps people accomplish their goals. Our Research Is Focused On Two Interconnected Aims— Motivated By The Practical Challenges Presented By Large-scale AI And Inspired By The Amazing Things That Our Human Intelligence Does So Well Adaptability:We strive to develop AI that is adaptable across a broad range of previously unseen environments and tasks and developing methods for interacting with AI models to achieve outcomes that match our intent. Efficiency: Scale has been enabling the models to reach new heights in capabilities but also made them expensive to use and deploy. We aim to create AI systems that can smoothly scale to fit any computational footprint, from the cloud to the edge. We are seeking candidates for several internship positions with experience in natural language processing and deep learning.
