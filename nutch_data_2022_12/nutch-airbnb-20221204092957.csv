The Community You Will Join Airbnb.org is an independent 501c3 nonprofit that connects displaced people to emergency housing in times of crisis. The inspiration for Airbnb.org began in 2012 with a single Host named Shell who opened up her home to people impacted by Hurricane Sandy. This sparked a movement and marked the beginning of a program that allows Hosts on Airbnb to provide stays for people in times of crisis, in partnership with nonprofits, governments, and other organizations. Since then, the program has evolved to focus on emergency response and to help provide stays to evacuees, refugees, asylum seekers, and frontline workers fighting the spread of COVID-19. From Australia to France, Hosts have offered to open up their homes and helped provide accommodations to over 170,000 Airbnb.org guests. This position is employed by Airbnb Inc., however the role (along with the whole team) provides direct support to the nonprofit. Airbnb.org is governed by an independent board of directors.
