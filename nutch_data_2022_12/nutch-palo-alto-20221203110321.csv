Job Description Your Career You will manage technology partnerships for our NGFW and Security Services product offerings that will solve security business challenges and manage integration pipeline and evaluation and recommendations for partnership to move to our higher tiers. This individual will work with both Business Development technical leads, as well as GTM, marketing and Product Management teams , along with partner counterparts to drive efforts from onboarding partnership to evaluating and presenting on recommendations for emerging partnerships that can drive joint value and co-sell opportunities. The role will focus on delivering measurable results, including, analysis and recommendations for potential emerging partnerships validation pipeline, event metrics, opportunity influence, and focused GTM efforts that will drive co-sell opportunities. What makes PANW’s Technology Partnerships team special Every technology company has a Technology Partnerships team. What makes the team at Palo Alto Networks special is the following: Security is one of the most fragmented technology stacks. A typical large enterprise has up to 75 different security products. Customers expect our products to support integrations with hundreds of other products. APIs are not an afterthought but a critical component of our upstream product design, the MVP feature set, and subsequent roadmap updates. Our APIs are extremely well maintained and frequently updated. In certain product areas like Cortex xSOAR, we commit to giving our partners the same APIs and integration hooks that we make available to our internal teams for integrations within the PANW Product Suite. We have the most comprehensive product portfolio in the Security industry. As a result, we are building the most comprehensive and diverse product ecosystem. It extends from start-ups to the titans of the tech industry. It includes ISVs across all security categories, SaaS, Cloud Service Providers, Developer Stack, Identity & Access Management, Mobile Device Management, Email Providers, Analytics, Hardware OEMs, Network Equipment Providers, Network Infrastructure Providers, etc. Building our tech ecosystem requires a versatile set of partnership motions. In products like Cortex and Cortex xSOAR, our goal is to enable hundreds of partners to build applications to unlock a vast library of use cases. In other products like Next-Generation Firewall, we already have hundreds of integrations and are focused on ensuring these integrations stay validated as we update our core platform, move to the cloud, and launch new APIs. In Prisma Cloud and Prisma Access, the goal is to partner deeply with a relatively short list of Cloud Service Providers and Network Solution Providers. We have dedicated Partner Engineering and Solution Architect resources that work jointly with our partner managers in delivering high quality, secure, and reliable integrations. In certain instances, we build and maintain integrations. In other cases, we prescribe reference architectures and we validate the technical implementations. Sometimes, we even act as the first level of support so our customers can have reliable experiences. Our tech partnerships team is in the process of moving from a manual process to one that is more automated for better partner experience. The focus of the company in the last 3 years was to exponentially grow and onboard partners to meet customer needs and enhance our product offerings. With the need to validate existing partnerships and define a more mature approach to technology alliances, there is a big need to build, manage, and automate a program and processes. The company over the last few years has made many acquisitions and enhancements to the portfolio, and now has a multi-core business that includes the creation of the speedboats aligned to Strata, Cortex, and Prisma Cloud. As we are building end to end solutions, it has brought more complexity and extension of technology partnerships that include both inbound and outbound integrations. As we refine and grow the ecosystem, process and automation need to grow with us and allow the team to engage more partnerships yet limit resources needed to manage and drive deliverables. Your Impact Work closely with product management and go-to-market sales and marketing teams to define the partnership ecosystem for product segments within the Strata product group and partner verticals (current focus is Core NGFW group and Cloud-Delivered Security Services group, which can change with the product and go-to-market needs and internal focus future changes). Build and execute a plan for the segments of the product partnerships ecosystem defined above. Qualify, onboard, and manage relationships with strategic emerging and focus integration partners to generate clear and significant business value (brand recognition, metrics of the opportunities pipeline created, influenced, and direct revenues). Build an end-to-end partnership with clear business and customer value that have significant measurable value for all parties. Build and execute business plans with emerging partners. Oversee and support technical integration work, use case built, integration guides, and solution briefs. Build, coordinate, and lead various go-to-market initiatives including internal, intercompany, intra-companies, and external activities (customer, channel, and other routes to market we can amplify in the ecosystems team such as GSIs, MSSPs, SPs). Build relationships with senior and management-level leadership internally and with partner companies. Drive and Work on complex “coopetition scenarios” with partners, defining areas of cooperation or technical integration work for customers or partners’ needs. Qualifications Your Experience 3+ years’ experience business development and driving Integration technology partnerships and ecosystems Drive to grow existing business and develop innovative, and disruptive partnerships Ability to multitask and operate to manage critical partnerships and support the development of a low touch model of partnerships.
