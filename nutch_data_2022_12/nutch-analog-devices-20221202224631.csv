At ADI you will work alongside the brightest minds to collaborate on solving complex problems that matter from autonomous vehicles, drones and factories to augmented reality and remote healthcare. ADI fosters a culture that focuses on employees through beneficial programs, aligned goals, continuous learning opportunities, and practices that create a more sustainable future. ADI At A Glance Analog Devices operates at the center of the modern digital economy, converting real-world phenomena into actionable insight with its comprehensive suite of analog and mixed signal, power management, radio frequency (RF), and digital and sensor technologies. ADI serves 125,000 customers worldwide with more than 75,000 products in the industrial, communications, automotive, and consumer markets. ADI is headquartered in Wilmington, MA. Visit Position: CAD Engineer Title: Chip-Package System Engineering CAD Engineer: Implementation Manager: Nicholas Swart Project Description Analog Devices is an industry leader in the design of ICs and packaged systems. Our system products include signal-chain solutions, RF, power, MEMS, large SOC-in-package transceivers, and more. Packages used include laminates through to 3D technologies. System components can be off-the-shelf ICs, system-specific custom ICs, heterogenous “chiplet” blocks, and discrete components. IC technologies range from III/V, to BiCMOS, to high voltage nodes, to 16nm CMOS and below. Numerous design challenges arise at the system level in the areas of package modeling, chip-package co-design/optimization, system-level simulation, verification, and others. CAD tools and flows are essential in enabling these complex system-level products to be developed on schedule and with first-time success. A key area in system-level CAD is implementation, and Analog Devices’ Chip Package System Enablement (CPSE) team is seeking talented CAD engineers to work on developing industry-best-of-class chip-package system implementation tools/flows for ADI designers. Responsibilities This is a new college graduate position. The successful candidate will be part of ADI’s Chip-Package System Engineering team and will work closely with some of the world’s leading system designers to ensure the developed tools/flows have a measurable positive impact on design project success. The ideal candidate will have a sound understanding of IC design concepts. While system-level tool/flow implementation experience is not a requirement it is a plus. The candidate will work closely with commercial EDA tool vendors to apply and importantly augment their offerings, while also developing tool interfaces and/or new tools as needed. Qualifications MS in EE, CS, or related field Solid understanding of IC front to back design flows, and familiarity with relevant tools such as Cadence’s Virtuoso/VXL/VRF/DRC/LVS tool suite Understanding of system-level tools, example Cadence’s Allegro, VMT/VRF Understanding of IC-system package technologies (wire-bonded BGA, SiP, PoP, interposers, micro-bump stacking, bumpless stacking) Understanding of IP re-use and integration Analog/mixed-signal circuit fundamentals and general IC technology fluency Excellent scripting skills for tool integration and flow development and automation (Python, Perl, …) Software development competency (Skill, C++, … ) General experience with IC EDA tools and building value-add flows around such tools Allegro design methods and flows that bridge IC and package domains Assembly manufacturing product life cycle knowledge Technology deployment and administration (PDKs, rules and best practice) Design data management systems Good communication skills are an asset. You will be collecting and coordinating the EDA requirements of design teams worldwide, including future needs. You will collaborate with designers, EDA tool vendors, and possibly research institutions. You will support the worldwide introduction of design flows as well as the documentation and training of end users. Note: Applicants do not need to have experience in all the areas listed above. Motivated individuals with a solid foundation of skills developed from IC industry experience or school/internships who wish to contribute to ADI’s Chip-Package System Engineering team are strongly encouraged to apply.

Visit Consider the possibility of being part of an elite team of talented, eccentric developers residing within a semiconductor company. We solve real problems that intersect the physical world so that at the end of the day you have some thing to show for your hard work. If you love writing software, solving crazy hard problems, and don’t mind being different than your peers then you might like working here. In fact, we have several team members who have been coding since middle school. Analog Devices might sound like a place that has nothing to do with software, but this is absolutely not the case! In this position you will be developing tools for state-of-the-art software-defined radios. These tools take on many forms – GUIs, DSLs, frameworks, libraries, system solvers, scripts, enhanced CI/CD systems, etc. Language technologies vary from C/C++ to Python to C# and others. The subject matter is largely data converters and signal processing. Having expertise in these areas is strongly preferred but not required. Our team passionately wants to delight our customers with world-class evaluation and development experiences which are distinguished in our industry. What good is having state-of-the-art hardware if you don’t have state-of-the-art software? Then again you might prefer the alternative. You could apply for a major software company. You might even pass the interview process with flying colors. What then? You’ll spend the rest of your life trying to differentiate yourself, proving your value as a top-notch developer just like the other 30 bazillion rock star hot-shot ninjas on the West Coast. You decide. The interview starts now! Let Fib(n) be the string formed by concatenating the first n sequential Fibonacci numbers (i.e. Fib(0) = 1, Fib(1) = 11, Fib(2) = 112, …).
