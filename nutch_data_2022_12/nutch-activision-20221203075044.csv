Character Tech Art Internship (Egerton Internship): The Egerton Internship is an opportunity within Activision’s Central Tech group in Los Angeles, created in honor of a long-time Activision artist and animator, Jamie Egerton, whom we recently lost after an 18-month battle against brain cancer. His wry sense of humor was combined with an unsurpassed work ethic and critical eye. He drove us to work harder, create new ways of doing things, and shake our heads as much as laugh. He was an irreplaceable team member, and a good friend. Jamie worked in the MoCap studio on every Call of Duty title that Treyarch has made, as well as many other games. We’ll miss his presence in the office and his Transformers Jeep in the parking lot. It’s a big pair of boots to step into, but we’re looking for a promising and tough-minded student to carry on his work here with us.

Experience with Motion Builder, Blade, Z-Brush, Agisoft, Faceware and other relevant software. Knowledge of Motion Capture, FACS, human facial anatomy, facial animation and related topics are a plus. Your Mission  Collaborate with our Capture Studio teams, assisting with day-to-day development issues, identifying problems and finding creative solutions. Working with software such as Maya, MotionBuilder, and Photoshop, as well as custom and proprietary software and tools. You’ll create rigs, character art, animation and other assets to test in-development tools and pipelines. You’ll be cleaning up, modifying, and QC-ing facial/body animation and performance capture data - working directly with the department Directors to identify and complete the art/animation goals of the group.
