Job Summary This job code is to be used for internships and co-ops. It is not to be used for temporary or contract workers. Job Description In Connected Living, we build large-scale, syndicated mobile applications and services used by millions of customers. If you want exposure to complex systems in a collaborative environment, come join us for a summer to get a jumpstart on your career! We value mentorship through hands-on learning and are passionate about providing a supportive environment for you to grow and enjoy your experience as an intern. Who are we? Connected Living is comprised of various squads and crews that represent components of Xfinity app functionality. The Xfinity app is our touchpoint to all the services we provide to customers, including Wi-Fi and account management, along with customer care and troubleshooting. You’ll work within your crew — a group of client and platform engineers. You’ll collaborate with product, UX, and other engineering teams on a specific feature or area of the Xfinity App. Prior to your arrival, we’ll select a seasoned team to match you with based on your skillset, learning goals, and interests. We will also provide you with supporting materials for you to review in advance of joining us to better prepare you. Upon your arrival, we will partner you with a “buddy” within your team to be your main point of contact for help and support at any time throughout the internship. You’ll also have regular check-ins with a lead on your team to identify goals, clarify expectations, and discuss your accomplishments and address any concerns. Every teammate is empowered to show a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for our customer experience. This includes code quality that follows best practices, so you’ll take part in guild meetings that give you exposure to how we establish standards. You’ll also join us in other team meetings and be encouraged to fully participate and ask questions. Our organization will also have monthly team gatherings to help foster a sense of belonging and community amongst the teams. Some past events in 2022 included Smash Bros and Tetris gaming tournaments, karaoke nights, and board game days. Individual teams will also have their own separate team-building events. What will you work on? An intern will be exposed to all areas of the software development lifecycle including planning, requirements analysis, design/architecture, development, testing, release, and maintenance. They will work alongside their teammates to solve issues at any stage. For example, an intern could fix an issue in production that impacts customer satisfaction, clarify the details of a new feature with our product and design teams, or build frameworks and libraries that accelerate development across the organization. We encourage all members of the team to have a desire to see the big picture/the whole project, not just the piece that they are working on. It’s no different for our interns.
