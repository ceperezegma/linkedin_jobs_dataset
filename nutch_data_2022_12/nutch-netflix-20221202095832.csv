Our Netflix product has also evolved, to reach a better product-market fit and optimize for our members’ joy. An ever increasing product richness requires ever increasing security precautions, yet nimble enough to maintain business agility. In order to contain the increasing complexity of our security requirements, and better adapt these requirements to an evolving industry, a heightened fraud risk, and an increasing number of partners, the “Security Product and Partnerships” team, which you would be part of, is tasked with defining our Security product framework, and engage with those who use it, evolve it over time and balance strong security with clarity and efficiency of engagement.

We create solutions with high leverage that multiply the productivity of other teams. Our platforms act as an enabler for media processing teams. One of our main products is Stratum, a large-scale, next generation serverless function platform designed to handle media specific computational tasks. Stratum is the foundation of the Cosmos platform for media processing. Our team’s products are critical to Netflix— every video in the Netflix catalog has been processed by Stratum or one of its predecessors. Stratum is the primary compute platform for most engineers at Netflix in the media processing space. Stratum uses another complementary product that we develop, MezzFS, a FUSE based solution for efficiently accessing large files in S3. We also develop Nirvana, an observability solution for media processing workloads that run on top of Stratum. Due to CSI’s high scale, the impact of even minor improvements to the efficiency or developer experience of our products is enormous. CSI is part of a media-focused engineering group which provides highly available infrastructure for content production and processing across all Netflix productions and licensed content. Infrastructure pieces like massive scale media processing platforms (1, 2), workflows (Conductor), media asset management, collaboration, reporting, data movement, and data processing are some of the key services we build. All of this is custom built on top of Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. About The Role As an engineer on CSI you will help us build and grow innovative solutions in the media compute space. You’ll work on resource scheduling in a distributed polyglot compute platform running at massive scale. You’ll gain exposure to building observable, efficient, highly available and fault tolerant systems.
