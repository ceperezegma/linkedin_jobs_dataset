Validation engineers are said to have a ""break-the-part"" mentality. This means they spend some of their time working to identify the use-cases in which the device will stop working as intended and understand the impact and cause of those failures. Sometimes, those are acceptable failures, but others we may need to mitigate for quality, safety, or other reasons. Plus, we want to ensure that our parts are consistently performing to the specifications that we set in our data sheet, and even to some more conservative limits or as defined in the VVCM (validation/verification compliance matrix). To do this, they must design PCB boards and develop automation software that will increase coverage and reduce data collection time. Validation engineers will also design, develop, and implement necessary methods of measuring device performance and troubleshooting any related systems, equipment or device issues that arise. Validation engineers are often working in a post-silicon lab or on the software programs required to run their measurements.

About The Job Test is a crucial time in an IC development process; if you find a bug or an issue, it is a good time to fix it, but every additional second of testing we do, is additional cost when you scale a device into production. So, test engineers must identify the critical points of the device where testing is most necessary and the points where we may want to take some risk. It is a precise balance, that has the potential to save our businesses millions of dollars! Test engineers spend a good amount of time in the lab and when they're not there, they are designing test hardware using software tools like cadence and building test programs on an ATE simulator, or troubleshooting – the programs or the device.
