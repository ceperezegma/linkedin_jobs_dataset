Would you like have an impact on patients’ lives and contribute to eliminate cancer as a cause of death? If so then join us! We’re investing like never before in our people, in growth, and in new diagnostic techniques and technologies. There are opportunities at every turn, with a variety and breadth that is uncommon to find and an industry-leading pipeline in oncology. Scientists at AstraZeneca are working every day to turn science fiction into science fact. Our ambition - to develop innovative, targeted medicines for every patient that needs them - and to match those treatments to patients most likely to benefit from them – is now a reality. This approach, known as Precision Medicine, is based on those individual characteristics that make some patients respond to treatment better than others. We use this knowledge to develop diagnostic tests that doctors can use to help prescribe the best treatment for each patient. Indeed, it’s now become common practice for patients with cancer to be offered such diagnostic tests before their treatment plan is agreed. The AstraZeneca Companion Diagnostics Unit within the Precision Medicine and Biosamples function drives scientific leadership through the delivery of innovative companion diagnostics enabling our oncology ambition to transform the lives of patients living with cancer, and ultimately eliminate cancer as a cause of death. We do this by: Leading the development of diagnostics across AstraZeneca’s early and late stage oncology portfolios through close collaborations with our external diagnostic partners.

Our postdocs are respected as specialists, encouraged to speak up, and supported to share their research at conferences, publish papers, achieve their goals and make a difference to our patients. This is a 3 year programme, with an initial 2 year period and 1 year, merit-based extension. About the Opportunity: Immuno-Oncology (IO) therapeutic area focuses on developing the next-generation drugs that will improve the ability of the immune system to fight cancer. The tumour microenvironment is often infiltrated with immune cells that have reached a dysfunctional state and express multiple inhibitory receptors. A class of drugs that diminish immune cell dysfunction within the tumour micro-environment are called immune checkpoint inhibitors. In most cases, immune checkpoint inhibitors are antibodies that block the function of inhibitory receptors upregulated on the surface of immune cells within tumours. Immune checkpoint antibodies that target two such inhibitory receptors on T cells, PD-1 and CTLA4, have become standard of care in multiple cancer indications. Antibodies against other inhibitory receptors either alone or in combination with approved anti-PD1/PD-L1 drugs are currently under clinical development. Bispecific antibodies offer the advantage of simultaneous blockade of two receptors in one therapeutic molecule. Accordingly, many bispecific antibodies targeting inhibitory receptors are under clinical investigation. AstraZeneca’s Durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) is approved for multiple cancer indications. Building on the therapeutic successes of IO, AstraZeneca has initiated clinical studies with three bispecific antibody drug candidates: anti-PD-1 x anti-CTLA4 (MEDI5752), anti-PD-1 x anti-TIGIT (AZD2936), and anti-PD-1 x anti-TIM-3 (AZD7789). As a Postdoctoral Fellow, you will deliver research that will help understand the role of co-inhibitory molecules within the immune synapse. You will also research how the blockade of these molecules modifies the synapse and determine the mechanism by which co-blockade of two inhibitory receptors on T cells through the use of bispecific antibodies differs from blockade achieved by the combination of monospecific antibodies. This will be achieved by microscopy-based experiments performed on antigen-specific primary T cells interacting with glass-supported lipid bilayers presenting antigen, adhesion and checkpoint ligands or the same T cells interacting with tumour cells. Ultimately, these experiments will quantify ligand binding, receptor distribution and signaling events within the immune synapse. In this Postdoc position, you will perform experiments with the support of Rajat Varma, Director, Oncology Research at AstraZeneca and the academic guidance of Michael Dustin, Professor of Molecular Immunology at the University of Oxford. You will be expected to detail your findings in electronic notebooks, analyse imaging data to extract quantitative information, present data to internal teams, and prepare data for publications. Why You Should Apply: This is an outstanding opportunity to understand the MOA of clinical drug candidates using innovative microscopy techniques in an industry environment. This opportunity will allow the postdoc to experience industry life while remaining connected with academia. The department is equipped with powerful microscopes including one capable of total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and super-resolution spinning disc confocal microscopy. Working in a multidisciplinary, well-supported environment, the postdoc will have an opportunity to publish good science and lead the project with support from the AZ supervisor and mentorship of the academic expert.
