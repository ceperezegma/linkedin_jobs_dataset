Self-driving cars, autonomous delivery vehicles, and autonomous construction vehicles, among others, are getting increasingly close to widespread deployment. However, fundamental research questions still need to be addressed in order to achieve full vehicle autonomy. For instance, how can we: Remove the traditional barriers among perception, prediction, and planning in order to improve overall system performance? Equip autonomous vehicles with online and offline assurances that meet the standards for safety-critical systems? Ensure that autonomous vehicles work seamlessly in new places?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are some of the exciting questions that the newly-established NVIDIA Autonomous Vehicle Research Lab will be tackling. The lab will bring together a diverse, interdisciplinary research team working on core topics in vehicle autonomy, ranging from perception and prediction to planning and control, as well as critical related areas such as decision making under uncertainty, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and the verification and validation of safety-critical AI systems. The lab will focus on basic research; lab members will be encouraged to publish their work and open-source code. NVIDIA is well known for its team culture, and lab researchers will be able to closely interact with others within the company who are experts in perception systems, machine learning, and robotics.
